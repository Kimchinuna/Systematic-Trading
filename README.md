# Systematic-Trading
📊 Systematic-Trading : Arbitrage Trading Algorithms
Welcome to my GitHub repository! 
This is a comprehensive collection of statistical arbitrage trading codes that I have developed in Python. 
It is a perfect destination for anyone who wants to explore the fascinating world of financial markets from the perspective of data analysis and algorithmic trading.

📝 Project Description
This repository contains Python-based codes that explore the concept of Systematic Trading. 
The main focus is on Statistical Arbitrage, a quantitative trading strategy often employed by hedge funds and proprietary trading firms.

Statistical arbitrage relies on complex mathematical models to identify and exploit market inefficiencies. 
The algorithmic strategies in this repository are designed to provide a statistical edge and yield risk-adjusted returns that are less correlated with market direction.

🧰 Features
Efficient Code: Clean, efficient and well-documented Python codes which are easy to understand and modify.

Algorithmic Strategies: Detailed implementation of various arbitrage strategies, taking advantage of price discrepancies and market inefficiencies.

Data Analysis: Extensive use of data analytics libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to manipulate, analyze, and visualize financial data.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

To get the most out of these codes, you should have a basic understanding of:

Python programming
