# 📚 Sentiment Analysis Project: Leveraging VADER & News API

This project is a comprehensive exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a focus on sentiment analysis. 
By using Python, the VADER Sentiment Analysis tool, and the News API, we're able to efficiently scrape, process, and analyze news data to extract sentiment insights.

📝 Project Description

This project is designed to demonstrate the power of NLP in gauging sentiment from a variety of news sources.
We utilize the VADER sentiment analysis tool to provide insightful quantitative measures of sentiment. 
This approach allows us to move beyond simple keyword counts and into a deeper understanding of language and sentiment in news reporting.
