📈 Leverage-SP500: Time-Horizon Analysis for x3 Leveraged SP500 ETF

This project is dedicated to exploring the optimal time horizon for trading a leveraged SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). 
The aim is to analyze different very short time intervals, such as 5, 10 minutes, and so forth, to identify the best moment for entering or exiting the market when dealing with this specific financial instrument.

📝 Project Description

The SP500 is one of the most closely watched indexes in the world, and trading its leveraged ETFs can provide opportunities for significant returns, but also considerable risk. 
In this project, we take a deep dive into this high-risk, high-reward world, by applying rigorous data analysis techniques to answer a crucial question: "When is the best time to buy a x3 leveraged SP500 ETF?"

Through this exploration, we hope to provide traders and investors with valuable insights that can inform their trading strategies and potentially enhance their returns.
